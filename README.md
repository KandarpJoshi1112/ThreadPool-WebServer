# ThreadPool Web Server  

## Overview  
The **ThreadPool Web Server** is a Java-based concurrent server using a fixed thread pool to efficiently manage multiple client connections. Load testing and capacity evaluation were performed using Apache JMeter.  

## Features  
- **Thread pool implementation** for efficient resource management.  
- **Handles multiple concurrent requests** with optimized threading.  
- **Load testing with JMeter** to analyze server performance.  

## How It Works  
- The **server** listens on port `8080`, accepting multiple connections.  
- A **fixed thread pool** manages client requests, reducing thread creation overhead.  
- The **JMeter test plan** is used to simulate high user loads and measure performance.  

## Setup and Usage  
### Prerequisites  
- Java (JDK 8 or later)  
- Apache JMeter (for load testing)

## Running the Project
1. **Compile the files:**
   ```sh
   javac Server.java 
   ```
2. **Start the server:**
   ```sh
   java Server
   ```

## Now Load Testing with JMeter
1. Open `ThreadPoolTest.jmx` in Apache JMeter.
2. Configure the number of threads (users) and test duration.
3. Run the test to analyze performance metrics such as response time and throughput.

## Performance Testing
- The JMeter test plan simulates **30,000 concurrent users** over **30 seconds**.
- Performance metrics such as response time, success rate, and error handling are collected.
- The test plan includes graphical and tabular result analysis.
